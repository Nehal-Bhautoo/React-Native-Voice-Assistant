This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Description

Design, prototype and evaluate a Voice-based user interface that is designed to support Computer Science students access information relevant to their studies and to university life.
This application help students to find book using google books api and references the valid book in user commands.  

This could take many forms, but is likely to have some important features:

	- The user can control the system by issuing voice commands. 
	- The language of commands that a user is able to use may be complex.
	- The response to user commands may take a variety of forms, through speech, text, or some combination of the two.

**Google Book API**

###### Overview

The APIs in the [Google Books API](https://developers.google.com/books/docs/overview) Family let you bring Google Books features to your site or application. 
The new Google Books API lets you perform programmatically most of the operations that you can do interactively on the Google Books website.

## Web Speech API

The [Web Speech API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Web_Speech_API) makes web apps able to handle voice data. There are two components to this API:

Speech recognition is accessed via the SpeechRecognition interface, which provides the ability to recognize voice context from an audio input (normally via the device's default speech recognition service) and respond appropriately. Generally you'll use the interface's constructor to create a new SpeechRecognition object, which has a number of event handlers available for detecting when speech is input through the device's microphone. The SpeechGrammar interface represents a container for a particular set of grammar that your app should recognize. Grammar is defined using JSpeech Grammar Format (JSGF.).

Speech synthesis is accessed via the SpeechSynthesis interface, a text-to-speech component that allows programs to read out their text content (normally via the device's default speech synthesiser.) Different voice types are represented by SpeechSynthesisVoice objects, and different parts of text that you want to be spoken are represented by SpeechSynthesisUtterance objects. You can get these spoken by passing them to the SpeechSynthesis.speak() method.

### Commands List
